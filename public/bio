My name is Daus Carmichael. I currently teach math for a living, but my true passion is discovering and solving new problems (…at least new to me). This is what first drew me to physics and later computer science. Since I have come to enjoy a much more profound understanding of the world around me, I have gained insight into several areas, while simultaneously recognizing how little I know.

My key interests include sports analytics, predictions models, and machine learning. I build lots of projects with these in mind.

If you’re hiring or want to chat coding with me, I’d love to hear from you - reach out on LinkedIn.
