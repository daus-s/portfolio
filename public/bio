My name is Daus Carmichael, I currently teach math but my true passion is solving new problems (at least new to me). This is what first drew me to physics and later computer science. Since I have come to enjoy a much more profound understandng of the world around m giving me insights into many areas, and simultaneously showing how little I know. However this has not. I am very interested in sports analytics, predictions models, and machine learning.
