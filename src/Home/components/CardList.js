                description="My name is Davis Carmichael, although I go by Daus. (exclusively). I graduated from Chapman University in December 2022 with 2 degrees; one a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Physics, and the other a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I competed in track and field and cross country in college. I am from Issaquah in Washington State. This meant the outdoors became a very important part of my life. I loved running on the trails in the hills as well as snowboarding in the mountains 45 minutes from home. I grew up very interested in science and my curiosity has yet to leave me. I am always looking to learn and figure out more and more. As I explained, with more and more problems, I will continue to add projects I complete here."

The code uses a file of valid guesses as well as valid words to create the possible words that could be used in wordle. Then the user inputs into the command line interface the word chosen and the results (the black, yellow, green values). These correspond to where the letters in the guessed word go. If you are not familiar with the game, if the letter returns black then that letter does not exist in the word, if it is yellow it exists in that word but not in that index, if the letter is green that letter exists in that spot.

                description="The inspiration for this project came from a place of boredom. While working on intro-level physics problems for my job as an SI, I soon realized that I was often solving the same equation over and over. I would simply be solving for different variables. So, I used desmos to write the equation out and get the values that the students were given.  I would get the final result of the question very easily but I still had to rewrite the equation. If I were able to write the equations necessary for one problem could I plug in the values and find all of the answers for the problems?"

                description="In my technical communications course our group was assigned an issue prevalent to college students (our audience). Our group researched internet addiction and misuse and determined it to be a worthwhile topic to inform our class on. This class is a CS/CE and SE major requirement. CS majors had naturally higher levels of dependence on the internet and so informing them on healthy internet use was more important than it may be for other groups on campus. This presentation has a test to determine the 'level' of internet addiction one is experiencing. This test is not necesarily indicative of your actual level of addiction but it does give a baseline. Feel free to take the test, the results will be uploaded to a dataset and will be completely anonymous. The team that worked on this project included me (Daus), Benjamin Kahn, Keoni Lanoza, Moises Lopez. "
